# Medical Abstracts Classification - NLP Project
This project focuses on classifying medical abstracts into four categories using NLP techniques. It involves:

1. Text cleaning and preprocessing

2. Feature extraction with TF-IDF

3. Handling class imbalance

4. Training and comparing multiple machine learning models

5. Evaluating model performance

Visualizations: word clouds and topic modeling for deeper analysis

The goal is to build accurate predictive models that provide meaningful insights into medical abstracts.
This projectâ€™s classifier helps manage the overwhelming flow of new medical research by automatically sorting it,
saving researchers and clinicians valuable time and helping them quickly find the studies they need to make informed decisions.

The dataset used is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TimSchopf/medical_abstracts
